# Starbucks-Analysis
Starbucks Promotion Strategy Analysis
Project Overview

This project utilizes data provided by Starbucks to understand and predict the effectiveness of promotional campaigns in driving product sales. The dataset consists of demographic and behavioral attributes of customers, along with information about whether they received a promotional offer and if they subsequently made a purchase.

The main objectives of this analysis are:

* To understand patterns within customer features that correlate with a higher likelihood of making a purchase upon receiving a promotion.
* To evaluate the success of these promotions using metrics like Incremental Response Rate (IRR) and Net Incremental Revenue (NIR).

Dataset

The dataset contains approximately 120,000 individual records, split into training and test sets. Each record provides insight into an individual's profile through seven abstract features, labeled from V1 to V7. Additionally, the dataset documents if a promotion was extended to an individual and the outcome of that promotion.
Analysis

The analysis journey encompasses:

* Detailed exploratory data analysis to understand distributions and patterns.
* Addressing class imbalance issues prevalent in the dataset.
* Building predictive models, primarily using Random Forest, to predict the likelihood of a purchase upon receiving a promotion.
* Evaluating the models using metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
